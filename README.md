**NOTE**: This repository has been archived and is no longer actively maintained. The project has evolved and shifted its primary focus to Python. As a result, it has been moved to a new independent repository. Please visit [ee_lst](https://github.com/lunasilvestre/ee_lst) for the active project.

This repository was originally forked from [Landsat_SMW_LST](https://github.com/sofiaermida/Landsat_SMW_LST) and served as a starting point for our enhanced Python-based library. We're grateful for the foundational work done in the original repository.
